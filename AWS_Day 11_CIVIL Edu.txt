Client...Some (3) Apps...Generates 100s of files on everyday...Do you have any service where i can store all these 100s of files...I want to host all these Apps on single platform...

As per the clients companies policy, once a file is generated, only for 3 months, they are going to be used by the customers. After 3 months, these files may or maynot be accessed by the customers or the apps may or maynot use these files. For the next 6 months, these files are not used frequently but whenever the client company requires these files, he needs to be accessed. For the next 24 months, files should be there but they maynot need an immediate access to the files.
