Understanding the DevOps Culture â€“ Build & Deployment Process
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
~ For any project we will have the Dev Team and Ops Team.
~ Dev Team will write the code in different/same programming languages (Python, .net, Java)
~ In order to build/develop the application, we need to create a project folder structure. The project folder structure will be created by using a tool called as MAVEN.
~ In MAVEN, we will download all the dependencies that are required to fully develop the project.
~ Using MAVEN, developers will create the project, download the dependencies, compile the project, unit test execution, packaging the code (JAR or WAR files)
~ Once the above process is done, all the developers code will be stored in one common platfrm known as GIT & GIITHUB (GIT Repository).
~ All the developers will be connected to the common GIT Repository and then they are going to PUSH the code into the repo.PROJECT SOURCE CODE.
~ Now, as a DevOps Engineers, we need to perform the BUILD & DEPLOYMENT process.
~ To perform the BUILD & DEPLOYMENT process, we are going to use JENKINS, which is the heart of the DevOps.
~ We can perform CI&CD using JENKINS.
~ Taking the code from repository and deploying that code into the servers is called as DEVOPS OPERATIONS.
~ Taking the code from repository and keeping the code into the servers is called as DEPLOYMENT.
~ JENKINS will be integrated with GIT Repo. to get the source code.
~ Then JENKINS will interact with MAVEN to compile the code and code will be packaged as a JAR or WAR file.
~ JENKINS will also be integrated with SONARQUBE to test/perform the code quality analysis.
~ The configuration will then be done to the application using ANSIBLE.
~ Now the Application will go LIVE.
This entire process is called as BUILD & DEPLOYMENT.
~ We can also achieve the CI&CD using JENKINS
