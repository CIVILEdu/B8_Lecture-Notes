Operating System (OS)
--------------------------------
~ OS is a software which is used to interact with the computer.

~ OS will act as a mediator between the users and the computer hardware components.

~ OS Types: Windows, Vista, Linux, Mac OS....

~ OS is mandatory for any computer to work with.

~ OS provides an environment to run the applications.

Windows OS:
------------------
~ It is a single user based OS
~ Developed by Microsoft 
~ Paid OS
~ Windows OS is suggested purely for personal use
~ It is based on GUI

Linux OS:
------------------
~ It is a multi user based OS
~ Developed by Linus Torvalds
		Minux = Linux
~ Open Source
~ Recommended for Server, DBs, Applications Execution, Community based OS
~ It is not based on GUI
~ Linux is CLI (Command Line Interface) based

Linux Distributions/Flavours:
-----------------------------------------
Redhat Linux, Ubuntu, Cent OS, Amazon Linux, Debian, Suse, Fedora....


How to launch the Linux based EC2 Instance (to work with the Linux OS):
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AWS Console ... EC2 ... Launch one Linux based Instance ... Connect to the Linux Instance using MobaXTerm
From now we can work with the Linux Commands

Linux Commands:
-------------------------
1. whoami - It tells about the present user who is using the system
2. pwd - present working directory
	In Linux we have Directories (Folders) and Normal Files (Text Files)
3. mkdir <directory name> - Is used to create directory
4. ls -l (or) ls - Is used to list the directories and normal files available
5. rmdir <directory name> - Is used to delete a directory
6. cd <directory name> - Is used to change the directory
7. cd .. - To come out of a particular directory (one step backward)
8. cd ../.. - (two steps backward)
9. cd <directory name> Ex: cd ec2-user
10. cd <directory name>/<directory name>/<directory name>/<directory name>...... - Is used for multiple steps forward 

How to Create Normal Files (Text Files) in Linux?
------------------------------------------------------------------
In Linux, we can create a file in 3 different ways
1. touch
2. cat
3. vi

11. touch <File Name> - Is used to create a text file
12. cat > <File Name> - Is used to create a file with some content inside it
		control + d - Is used to close the file
13. cat <File Name> - Is used to see the content in a specific file
14. cat > <File Name> - Is used to write additional data in the existing file
15. To maintain old data in a file and create additional data in the same file - cat >> <File Name>
Points to remember:
	15.1 If we give one > symbol, it replaces the old data and maintains the latest data only.
	15.2 If we give two > symbols, it will keep the old data and latest data also.
16. rm <File Name> - Is used to delete a text file
17. ls -lr - Is used to display the files in reverse alphabetical order
Points to remember:
	17.1 By default, when we give ls or ls -l, it will print the files in the alphabetical order
18. ls -lt - Is used to display the files based on time stamp
19. How to identify whether it is a file or a directory?
		When we give ls -l, if the next line is starting with -, then it is a file. 
		When the line is starting with d, then it is a directory
20. ls -l <Directory Name> - Is used to print the content of a particular directory
21. rmdir <Directory Name> - Is used to delete a directory and the content inside it
Note: After excuting above command we will see error, because the directory is not empty.
Points to remember:
	21.1 rmdir is used to delete only empy directory
To forcefully delete the directory and the content inside it, rmdir -r <Directory Name>
