S3 Replication Setup
-------------------------------
S3 Bucket...shared with team members...
If we want to maintain a duplicate copy of original files for security reasons, then we can use Replication Setup.

Types of replication:
Replication can be made in 3 ways:
Root User...Main Bucket (Source Bucket).... Duplicate Bucket
1. Another bucket in the same region and same account
2. Another bucket in different region and same account
3. Another bucket in different account (Account A & Account B)

Main Objects (Standard Storage Class).... Duplicate objects (One Zone IA)
In replication setup, you can store the objects by changing the storage classes

-------------------------------
S3 Object Lock
-------------------------------
It can help you to prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten.
Additional layer of security to the objects.

Features of S3 Object lock:
------------------------------------
1. Retention modes:
1.1 Governance Mode:
Root User...created a bucket...uploaded an object...
In governance mode, root user will have all the permissions to delete the objects.

1.2 Compliance Mode:
In compliance mode, root user also cannot delete the objects.

2. Retention Period:
In retention period, you can specify the time limit of objects not getting deleted
Ex: 7 Days
Once after the retention period is expired, root user can delete the files

3. Legal holds:
It prevents an object version from being overwritten or deletion.
