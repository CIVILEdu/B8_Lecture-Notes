How to work with "Locate" and "Find" commands:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
~ "Locate" and "Find" commands are used to search for the files in Linux OS.
~ If you want to see the location of particular file, then we can use "locate" command
		Syntax: locate <File Name>
~ If you want to know how many files are available on a same name
		Syntax: locate -c <File Name>
~ If you want to see how many .txt files are available
		Syntax: locate -c *.txt
~ If you want to see all the list of .txt files and their path
		Syntax: locate *.txt

Point to remember: In Linux, all the files and directory locations will be stored in Local DataBase
							locate db

Working with "Find" command:
----------------------------------------------
"Find" command will search for files and directories in actual file system.
It provides advanced searching features
		Syntax: find <File Name>
		Syntax: find /home -name <File Name>
			Note: If the above command is excuted, you will see Permission Denied. It is because, you have to be a root user to perform the above command
		Syntax: sudo find /home -name <File Name>

If you want to search for the files which are empty:
	Syntax: sudo find /home -type f -empty

If you want to search for the directories which are empty:
	Syntax: sudo find /home -type d -empty
