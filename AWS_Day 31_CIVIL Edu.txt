Before the emerging of Cloud Computing how a networking used to be there in an organization:

LAN:
Local Area Network
LAN is used to connect theservers located in a single city/single area

MAN:
Metro Area Network
MAN is used to connect the servers located in a single city but in multiple locations

WAN:
Wide Area Network
WAN is used to connect the servers located in different locations or different cities

To create a VM (EC2 Instance), we need EC2, EBS, VPC
To create a VPC, we have to create a network
Depending upon the use the network is splitted into different parts, which are called as SUBNETS


IP Addressing:

To connect  one device with another device...IP Address is required.
IP - Internet Protocol
To connect one system with another system available in the same location, we will use LAN connection.
		LAN - It uses the Private IP
If two systems are to be connected without using LAN, then Public IP has to be used.

Types of IP addresses:
1. IPv4
32 bits
4 parts
101.100.100.100

2. IPv6
128 bits
6 parts
alpha numeric characters

IPv4 consists of 4 octets
Each octet contains 8 bits

Ex: 4x8 = 32 bits

If we give Ip range as /16,
2^32-16 = 2^16 = 65536 IPs

/32
2^32-32 = 2^0 = 1 IP

/30
2^32-30 = 2^2 = 4 IPs

/29
2^32-29 = 2^3 = 8 IPs

0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255

Different types of IPs:
1. Public IP
2. Private IP
3. Elastic IP

Terminology in VPC:
Subnets (Public Subnet & Private Subnet)
Internet Gateway
Route Tables
NAT Gateway
	is used to restrict incoming traffic and allow outgoing traffic
	NAT Gateway will; have ingress and aggress
NACL
Network Access Control List
SG
Security Groups
















VPC:
